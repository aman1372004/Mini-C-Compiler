# Compiler Design Lab - Project 3

## Semantic Analyzer for a Subset of the C Language

This module builds upon the parser developed in **Project 2**, and adds semantic analysis features to ensure the correctness of the program beyond syntax.

Semantic analysis ensures that the program follows the rules of the language like type compatibility, function usage, and more.
