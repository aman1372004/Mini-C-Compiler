# Mini C Compiler

This is a mini-compiler for a subset of the C language, built as part of our Compiler Design PBL Project (TCS-601).

The project was developed in four incremental phases, each representing an important component of a compiler:

| Phase     | Objective                                                                                           |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project-1 | Lexical Analysis: Build a lexical analyzer using Lex to tokenize C programs                         |
| Project-2 | Syntax Analysis: Build a parser using Yacc to parse tokens from the lexical analyzer                |
| Project-3 | Semantic Analysis: Implement semantic analysis on the parse tree generated in Project-2             |
| Project-4 | Code Generation: Generate Intermediate Code (ICG), Code optimization, and Target code generation    |
