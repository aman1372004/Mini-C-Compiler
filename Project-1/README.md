# Compiler Design Lab - Project 1

## Lexical Analyzer for a Subset of the C Language

This project implements a Lexical Analyzer using **Lex (Flex)** for a subset of the C language, as part of our **Compiler Design Lab Course (TCS601)**.

The analyzer reads a C-like source program and generates tokens, which are passed to the parser in the next phase of compilation.

Let me know if you want to:
- Add compilation instructions (`lex`, `gcc`, etc.)
- Show example input/output
- Extend for Project 2 `parser.y`

I'm here for all compiler vibes bro 🧠🔥
