## Syntax Analyzer (Parser) for a Subset of the C Language

This project implements a **Syntax Analyzer** using **Yacc (Bison)** for a subset of the C language.  
It works with the tokens generated by the Lexical Analyzer (from Project 1) and builds a parse tree, while also checking for grammar correctness and generating syntax errors (with line numbers).
